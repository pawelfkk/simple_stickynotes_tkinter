# Sticky Notes
A simple sticky notes application written in Python using the Tkinter library.

## Features
Create new notes by typing in the input field and clicking the "Add" button
View all notes in a list
Delete notes by selecting them in the list and clicking the "Delete" button
Error messages are displayed if the user tries to add an empty note or delete a note without selecting one
## Code Overview
The program uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI for the user to interact with. A list is used to store the notes and several functions are used to handle the different actions the user can take (adding a new note, deleting a note, updating the list of notes). The messagebox module is used to display error messages to the user.
